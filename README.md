Planning to start yet another business. This time I want to setup Books Library. 
Idea is to let people enjoy 10s and 1000s of books around the world. My vision is to be the BEST in Reader’s community…

Here is what I am thinking:

There are various membership packages available based on number of books that a reader can possess @ any given time & how long they can hold a book. Below are the packages (Launch Offer):
  Membership,	Number of Books allowed to be held @ a time,	Period in days for which each book is held,	Charges for every extra day per book,	Package Cost / year
    Ivory,	      3,	7,	20,	1000
    Silver,	    4,	10,	30,	2000
    Gold,    5,	15,	40,	3000
    Platinum,	6,	20,	50,	5000
1.	I have below book categories to start with:::
    a.	Arts
    b.	Business
    c.	Sports
    d.	Cooking
    e.	History
2.	These books are currently in 4 languages
    a.	English
    b.	Hindi
    c.	French
    d.	Spanish
3.	There are certain restrictions that I would want to impose. Here are they:::
    a.	Not more than 2 books of same sequel can be held @ any point in time
    b.	Not more than 3 books of same category and of same language can be held
    c.	Not more than 4 books in same language can be held
4.	@the time of returning a book, system should calculate any extra day charges and generate a receipt. If there are no extra day charges then system should accept the book and should print as `No Dues`
5.	It’s ok to sit in the library and read as much as you want. No charges.
6.	Maximum number of people that can sit in my library @ any given time are 30. 31st person should wait till someone comes out. This is mainly because of floor area I have.
7.	In future, I should be able to add more categories and more languages
8.	A reader can request for 1 extra book @ max. beyond his/her package limit @ a cost of 50 Rs. / book. Extra day charges still apply.
9.	It’s a yearly package, once my package expires, no further books can be borrowed. Existing books must be returned within 7 days of package expiry date.
10.	I intend to take a refundable deposit of 1000 Rs. For this.
11.	Me as a member, would get an ability to search the book availability and then get a physical copy.
